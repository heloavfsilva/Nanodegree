Submission (https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1125/view)
Your submission should be a PDF that includes:

An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
What tools did you use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
How did you calculate the moving average?
What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
Line chart with local and global temperature trends
At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends

Example of moving avg (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xjbclbaS2d4p4XqeVAzYgLXRVbp935xwisn3NAbVGHw/edit#gid=0)

Conda setup
download Anaconda
if you have already installed run: 
conda upgrade conda
conda upgrade --all

then configure you new enviroment
conda create -n py python=3
conda activate py

conda list: will show everything you have installed
conda install package_name: same funcion as pip install

conda env export > environment.yaml: will export the config to a file
conda env create -f environment.yaml: will create an env from a file

-------------------------
Jupyter setup
conda install jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook

Magic commands:
Magic commands are preceded with one or two percent signs (% or %%) 
for line magics and cell magics, respectively
%timeit: how long it takes for a function to run

%%timeit: how long it takes for a whole cell to run

interactive debugger? 
%pdb

Converting notebooks to other format: 
jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides
add the --post serve option to open up and present it in browser

Quantitative Variables
Then we learned there are four main aspects used to describe quantitative variables:

Measures of Center
Measures of Spread
Shape of the Distribution
Outliers
Measures of Center

We looked at calculating measures of Center:
Means
Medians
Modes
Measures of Spread

We also looked at calculating measures of Spread:
Range
Interquartile Range
Standard Deviation
Variance
Shape

We learned that the distribution of our data is frequently associated with one of the three shapes:
1. Right-skewed
2. Left-skewed
3. Symmetric (frequently normally distributed)

Depending on the shape associated with our dataset, certain measures of center or spread may be better for summarizing our dataset.

When we have data that follows a normal distribution, we can completely understand our dataset using the mean and standard deviation.

However, if our dataset is skewed, the 5 number summary (and measures of center associated with it) might be better to summarize our dataset.


Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics is about describing our collected data using the measures discussed throughout this lesson: measures of center, measures of spread, shape of our distribution, and outliers. We can also use plots of our data to gain a better understanding.

Inferential Statistics
Inferential Statistics is about using our collected data to draw conclusions to a larger population. Performing inferential statistics well requires that we take a sample that accurately represents our population of interest.

A common way to collect data is via a survey. However, surveys may be extremely biased depending on the types of questions that are asked, and the way the questions are asked. This is a topic you should think about when tackling the first project.

We looked at specific examples that allowed us to identify the

Population - our entire group of interest.
Parameter - numeric summary about a population
Sample - subset of the population
Statistic - numeric summary about a sample
